abstract: Molybdenum sulﬁde is a very promising catalyst for the photodegradation
  of organic pollutants in water. Its photocatalytic activity arises from unsaturated
  sulfur bonds, and it increases with the introduction of structural defects and/or
  oxygen substitutions. Amorphous molybdenum sulﬁde (a-MoSxOy) with oxygen substitutions
  has many active sites, which create favorable conditions for enhanced catalytic
  activity. Here we present a new approach to the synthesis of a-MoSxOy and demonstrate
  its high activity in the photodegradation of the dye methylene blue (MB). The MoSxOy
  was deposited on hexagonal boron oxynitride (h-BNO) nanoﬂakes by reacting h-BNO,
  MoCl5, and H2S in dimethylformamide (DMF) at 250 ◦C. Both X-ray diffraction analysis
  and high-resolution TEM show the absence of crystalline order in a-MoSxOy. Based
  on the results of Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, as well as analysis
  by the density functional theory (DFT) method, a chain structure of a-MoSxOy was
  proposed, consisting of MoS3 clusters with partial substitution of sulfur by oxygen.
  When a third of the sulfur atoms are replaced with oxygen, the band gap of a-MoSxOy
  is approximately 1.36 eV, and the valence and conduction bands are 0.74 eV and −0.62
  eV, respectively (relative to a standard hydrogen electrode), which satisﬁes the
  conditions of photoinduced splitting of water. When illuminated with a mercury lamp,
  a-MoSxOy/h-BNxOy nanohybrids have a speciﬁc mass activity in MB photodegradation
  of approximately 5.51 mmol g−1 h−1, which is at least four times higher than so
  far reported values for nonmetal catalysts. The photocatalyst has been shown to
  be very stable and can be reused.
