abstract: 'Abstract: The structure of new heterogeneous FePt/h-BN nanomaterials and
  their catalytic activity in the model reaction of carbon monoxide oxidation have
  been studied. The structure and surface composition were analyzed by methods of
  transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction.
  It is established that the new materials exhibit pronounced catalytic activity and
  can provide complete CO conversion at a temperature of 250°C. The process of thermal
  activation involves ordering of the structure of FePt nanoparticles. © 2021, Pleiades
