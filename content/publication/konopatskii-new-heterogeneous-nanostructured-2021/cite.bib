 abstract = {Abstract: The structure of new heterogeneous FePt/h-BN nanomaterials and their catalytic activity in the model reaction of carbon monoxide oxidation have been studied. The structure and surface composition were analyzed by methods of transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. It is established that the new materials exhibit pronounced catalytic activity and can provide complete CO conversion at a temperature of 250°C. The process of thermal activation involves ordering of the structure of FePt nanoparticles. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},
