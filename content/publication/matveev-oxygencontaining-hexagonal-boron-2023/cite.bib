 abstract = {New simple and scalable method for the synthesis of nanocrystalline Pt-containing hexagonal boron oxynitride (Pt/BN(O)) is proposed. At a minimum content of 0.0085~wt%, Pt is present only in the form of single atoms (SAs) and clusters. This sample demonstrates CO oxidation activity with specific CO2 productivity as high as 176 molCO2/gPt/h at 300~$^∘$C. The sample retains high catalytic activity after four cycles.},
