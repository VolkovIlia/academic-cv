abstract: The development of high-effective photodetectors operating in a wide spectral
  range is an important technological task. In this work we have demonstrated that
  the detection bandwidth of h-BN photodetectors in the UV range can be extended due
  to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. Theoretical calculations showed that,
  among Al, Au, Ag, and Cu, Al is the most suitable metal for the h-BN UV sensible
  detectors due to the SPR effect in the middle UV range. Based on the theoretical
  predictions, a simple and highly efficient method for obtaining h-BN/Al nanocomposites
  for localized SPR-based UV detectors was developed. It was demonstrated that the
  h-BN/Al material is sensitive to UV radiation with a wavelength of 266 nm that is
  far away of the detection limit of 240 nm inherent for pure h-BN.
