abstract: This work is aimed at the development of bimetallic (Ni0.2Cu0.8) catalysts
  with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheet (BNNS) supports and elucidating their
  catalytic activity in the methanol steam reforming and CO oxidation reactions. The
  hybrid Ni0.2Cu0.8/BN catalysts consist of curved h-BN nanosheets, up to 10–20 nm
  in lateral size, decorated with metallic nanoparticles, 3.0–8.2 nm in dimensions.
  The methanol conversion starts at ~20 °C and is nearly completed at 320 °C. The
  (Ni0.2Cu0.8)/BN nanohybrids exhibit high catalytic stability and high selectivity
  for CO2 over the whole temperature range. No carbon monoxide is detected during
  full methanol conversion. The possible mechanism of CO utilization during methanol
  reforming is proposed using ab initio calculations. The onset temperature of catalytic
  CO oxidation is 100 °C and full conversion is completed at 200 °C. These results
  indicate high catalytic efficiency of (Ni0.2Cu0.8)/BN nanohybrids in methanol steam
  reforming and CO oxidation reactions.
