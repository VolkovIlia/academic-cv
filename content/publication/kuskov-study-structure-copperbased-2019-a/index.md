abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of copper-based composite materials structure
  formation processes in the conditions of SPS. The structures of Cu--Cr, Cu--Mo,
  Cu--W, Cu--Cr--Mo, Cu--Cr--W, Cu--Mo--W, Cu--Cr--SiC, and Cu--Zr--CNTs two-component
  and three-component systems were analyzed. The possibility of the formation of non-equilibrium
  phases under SPS conditions is shown, the effect of chemical transformations on
  the structure of bulk composite materials is considered.
