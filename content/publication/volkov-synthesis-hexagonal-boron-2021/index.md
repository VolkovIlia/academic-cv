abstract: 'Abstract: Continuous nanocrystalline coatings of hexagonal boron nitride
  (h-BN) with a thickness of ~1000‒350 nm are prepared from highly concentrated aqueous
  solutions of lithium and sodium borates, which display good film-forming properties.
  The borate solutions were applied on silicon substrates by spin coating followed
  by drying in air and treatment in ammonia at a temperature of 1300°C. This method
  is deemed promising for creating protective coatings (e.g., for protecting carbon
  products from oxidation at elevated temperatures). © 2021, Pleiades Publishing,
