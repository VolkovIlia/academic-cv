 abstract = {Abstract: Continuous nanocrystalline coatings of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with a thickness of ~1000-350 nm are prepared from highly concentrated aqueous solutions of lithium and sodium borates, which display good film-forming properties. The borate solutions were applied on silicon substrates by spin coating followed by drying in air and treatment in ammonia at a temperature of 1300$^∘$C. This method is deemed promising for creating protective coatings (e.g., for protecting carbon products from oxidation at elevated temperatures). o̧pyright 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},
