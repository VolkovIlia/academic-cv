abstract: Environmental protection requires solving the problem of utilization and
  reduction of CO and CO2 emissions. Herein, Au/h-BN(O) and Pt/h-BN(O) nanohybrids
  are thoroughly analyzed in CO oxidation and CO2 hydrogenation reactions. The nanohybrids
  differ in catalytic particle size and particle distribution. The particles are smaller
  (1–6 nm) and display a narrower size distribution in the case of Pt-based nanomaterials.
  The Pt/h-BN(O) nanohybrids exhibit high catalytic activity in CO conversion and
  carbon dioxide hydrogenation reactions. For both systems, the oxidative state of
  BN support affects the catalytic activity. The possible catalytic reaction mechanisms
  are proposed based on DFT calculations. A charge density distribution at the Pt/h-BN
  interface increases oxygen absorption, thereby accelerating oxygen-associated chemical
  reactions.
