 abstract = {Environmental protection requires solving the problem of utilization and reduction of CO and CO2 emissions. Herein, Au/h-BN(O) and Pt/h-BN(O) nanohybrids are thoroughly analyzed in CO oxidation and CO2 hydrogenation reactions. The nanohybrids differ in catalytic particle size and particle distribution. The particles are smaller (1--6~nm) and display a narrower size distribution in the case of Pt-based nanomaterials. The Pt/h-BN(O) nanohybrids exhibit high catalytic activity in CO conversion and carbon dioxide hydrogenation reactions. For both systems, the oxidative state of BN support affects the catalytic activity. The possible catalytic reaction mechanisms are proposed based on DFT calculations. A charge density distribution at the Pt/h-BN interface increases oxygen absorption, thereby accelerating oxygen-associated chemical reactions.},
