summary: Approaches to developing boron nitride based catalysts
abstract: '(Cu,Zn)/h-BN heterogeneous nanostructures were successfully synthesized by wet chemistry reaction. Metal nanopartciles, 10-20 nm in dimension, were homogeneously distributed over the BN support. Nanocatalysts showed high catalytic activity in CO oxidation reaction.'
