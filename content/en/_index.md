        I focus on **innovative nanomaterials** and **heterogeneous catalysts** that address pressing challenges in ecology and energy. My work improves the efficiency of **oxidation and hydrogenation reactions**, as well as **methanol steam reforming**, **CO‚ÇÇ conversion**, and generating **clean energy from hydrogen**.

        ### 1. High-Performance Catalysts for Industrial Sustainability
        - Designing **bimetallic nanoparticles** (FePt, NiCu, Ag/Au) and coatings on **hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)** to lower reaction temperatures and enhance selectivity for CO oxidation and CO‚ÇÇ hydrogenation.
        - Collaborating with research institutes to develop advanced catalysts for **greenhouse gas** utilization, including hydrogen-based solutions in energy infrastructures.

        ### 2. Hydrogen Technologies & Clean Energy
        - Exploring materials and methods to **convert hydrogen directly into electricity**. Project ‚ÄúGiredmet‚Äù (featured in the media) highlights the potential of such systems for industry and transport.
        - Evaluating catalytic reforming of methanol and combined ‚Äúhydrogen + steam reforming‚Äù setups, crucial for low-carbon energy and fulfilling ESG criteria.

        ### 3. Photocatalysis & Environmental Cleanup
        - Leveraging oxide and boron-nitride nanomaterials for **photodegradation of organic pollutants** and deep oxidation of toxic emissions.
        - Special interest in **oxygen-doped BN (BNOx)**, which boosts light absorption and catalytic activity in both UV and visible wavelengths.

        ### 4. Novel Composite Materials
        - Employing wet-chemistry (polyol) approaches and **Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS)** to create nanostructured composites (Cu, Fe, Ni, Mo, W, etc.).
        - Emphasizing interfacial interactions and enhanced surface energy to stabilize nanoparticles and extend catalyst lifetimes.

        ### 5. Results & Perspectives
        - Achieved a **30‚Äì40% reduction in energy demand** for CO oxidation and elevated CO‚ÇÇ conversion efficiency.
        - New h-BN-based materials for **UV photodetectors** and photocatalytic systems, enabling advanced environmental monitoring and ‚Äúgreen‚Äù chemistry.
        - **Direct hydrogen-to-electricity** technologies lay the groundwork for the clean energy sector of the future.

        ## Why It Matters ‚Äî For Business & Academia
        - **Reduce Industrial Carbon Footprint**: Our technologies save resources, align with ESG trends, and enhance competitiveness in manufacturing.
        - **Accelerate the Shift to Clean Energy**: High-performance materials for low-temperature methanol reforming and CO‚ÇÇ utilization.
        - **Scalable Solutions**: Core methods adapt readily to commercial-scale plants and large-scale production of nanocatalysts.

        This comprehensive approach‚Äîfrom lab synthesis to rigorous testing‚Äîenables rapid delivery of **high-tech, eco-friendly** solutions for **automotive, petrochemical, and chemical** industries. I welcome **collaborations**, **industrial partnerships**, and **joint research** to drive the development of **energy-efficient and sustainable** technologies.
