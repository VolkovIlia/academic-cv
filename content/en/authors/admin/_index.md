## About Me

PhD (Eng.) and Head of R&D across materials science, heterogeneous catalysis, and nanotechnology. 7+ years bridging academic research with industrial delivery: standing up labs, deploying LIMS, running end-to-end research pipelines, and enforcing quality systems (GLP, GOST). I’ve led cross-functional teams of up to 8 with ~₽100M annual budgets and partner seamlessly with state corporations, research institutes, and private companies.

Since March 2025, I’ve served as a Project Manager at the Center for Expertise and Coordination of Informatization (CEKI), a federal institution under Russia’s Ministry of Digital Development. In the Ministry’s project office I lead performance monitoring of the federal project “Artificial Intelligence” — KPI tracking, delivery assurance, risk assessment, and stakeholder communications — and I implemented a RAG-based document-management workflow. CEKI functions as the Ministry’s ICT expert hub, while the AI federal project sits within the national project “Data Economy,” whose objective is to enable broad adoption of domestic AI technologies by businesses and citizens.

Open to roles: Head of R&D / Scientific Director, base from ₽600k (Moscow, St. Petersburg, other major cities); business travel welcome.

## Research Focus

My research centers on designing **bimetallic nanocatalysts** (FePt, NiCu, etc.) on **hexagonal boron nitride** (h-BN) and other substrates to lower process temperature and boost selectivity in CO oxidation, CO₂ hydrogenation, and direct hydrogen-to-electricity pathways.

### Key Directions

1. **Green Technologies & Hydrogen Energy**  
   - Developing advanced catalysts for **solid oxide fuel cells** and direct H₂-based power generation, as featured in [media coverage](https://strana-rosatom.ru/2023/11/16/giredmet-razrabotaet-tehnologiju-p/)  
   - Optimizing methanol reformation and low-carbon approaches

2. **Environmental Catalysis & Reduction of CO₂ Emissions**  
   - Utilizing new materials (BNOx, MoSxOy) for **photodegradation** of organic pollutants  
   - Exploring synergy of **h-BN** with precious metals to cut energy costs by 30–40%

3. **Nanomaterials & Powder Metallurgy**  
   - Employing wet chemistry, polyol processes, and **Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS)** for composites (Cu, Ni, Mo, W)  
   - Enhancing phase interfaces to stabilize nanoparticles and extend catalyst lifespans

4. **Industrial Scale-Up & ESG**  
   - Aligning with Rosatom’s strategy for next-gen renewable projects  
   - Driving commercialization and compliance, from lab prototypes to pilot production
