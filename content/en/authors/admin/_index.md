## About Me

PhD (Eng.) and Head of R&D across materials science, heterogeneous catalysis, and nanotechnology. 7+ years bridging academic research with industrial delivery: standing up labs, deploying LIMS, running end-to-end research pipelines, and enforcing quality systems (GLP, GOST). I’ve led cross-functional teams of up to 8 with ~₽100M annual budgets and partner seamlessly with state corporations, research institutes, and private companies.

Since March 2025, I’ve served as a Project Lead at the Center for Expertise and Coordination of Informatization (CEKI), a federal institution under Russia’s Ministry of Digital Development. In the Ministry’s project office I lead performance monitoring of the federal project “Artificial Intelligence” — KPI tracking, delivery assurance, risk assessment, and stakeholder communications — and I implemented a RAG-based document-management workflow. The federal project “Artificial Intelligence” is part of the national project “Data Economy and Digital Transformation of Government.”

## Research Focus

My research centers on designing **bimetallic nanocatalysts** (FePt, NiCu, etc.) on **hexagonal boron nitride** (h-BN) and other substrates to lower process temperature and boost selectivity in CO oxidation, CO₂ hydrogenation, and direct hydrogen-to-electricity pathways.

### Key Directions

1. **Green Technologies & Hydrogen Energy**  
   - Developing advanced catalysts for **solid oxide fuel cells** and direct H₂-based power generation, as featured in [media coverage](https://strana-rosatom.ru/2023/11/16/giredmet-razrabotaet-tehnologiju-p/)  
   - Optimizing methanol reformation and low-carbon approaches

2. **Environmental Catalysis & Reduction of CO₂ Emissions**  
   - Utilizing new materials (BNOx, MoSxOy) for **photodegradation** of organic pollutants  
   - Exploring synergy of **h-BN** with precious metals to cut energy costs by 30–40%

3. **Nanomaterials & Powder Metallurgy**  
   - Employing wet chemistry, polyol processes, and **Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS)** for composites (Cu, Ni, Mo, W)  
   - Enhancing phase interfaces to stabilize nanoparticles and extend catalyst lifespans

4. **Industrial Scale-Up & ESG**  
   - Aligning with Rosatom’s strategy for next-gen renewable projects  
   - Driving commercialization and compliance, from lab prototypes to pilot production
