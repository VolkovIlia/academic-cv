 abstract = {This paper is devoted to the study of copper-based composite materials structure formation processes in the conditions of SPS. The structures of Cu–Cr, Cu–Mo, Cu–W, Cu–Cr–Mo, Cu–Cr–W, Cu–Mo–W, Cu–Cr–SiC, and Cu–Zr–CNTs two-component and three-component systems were analyzed. The possibility of the formation of non-equilibrium phases under SPS conditions is shown, the effect of chemical transformations on the structure of bulk composite materials is considered.},
