abstract: 'Methylene blue (MB) is widely used as a test material in photodynamic therapy
  and photocatalysis. These applications require an accurate determination of the
  MB concentration as well as the factors affecting the temporal evolution of the
  MB concentration. Optical absorbance is the most common method used to estimate
  MB concentration. This paper presents a detailed study of the dependence of the
  optical absorbance of aqueous methylene blue (MB) solutions in a concentration range
  of 0.5 to 10 mg·L−1. The nonlinear behavior of optical absorbance as a function
  of MB concentration is described for the first time. A sharp change in optical absorption
  is observed in the range of MB concentrations from 3.33 to 4.00 mg·L−1. Based on
  the analysis of the absorption spectra, it is concluded that this is due to the
  formation of MB dimers and trimers in the specific concentration range. For the
  first time, a strong, thermally induced discoloration effect of the MB solution
  under the influence of visible and sunlight was revealed: the simultaneous illumination
  and heating of MB solutions from 20 to 80 °C leads to a twofold decrease in the
  MB concentration in the solution. Exposure to sunlight for 120 min at a temperature
  of 80 °C led to the discoloration of the MB solution by more than 80%. The thermally
  induced discoloration of MB solutions should be considered in photocatalytic experiments
  when tested solutions are not thermally stabilized and heated due to irradiation.
  We discuss whether MB is a suitable test material for photocatalytic experiments
  and consider this using the example of a new photocatalytic material—boron oxynitride
  (BNOx) nanoparticles—with 4.2 and 6.5 at.% of oxygen. It is shown that discoloration
  is a complex process and includes the following mechanisms: thermally induced MB
  photodegradation, MB absorption on BNOx NPs, self-sensitizing MB photooxidation,
  and photocatalytic MB degradation. Careful consideration of all these processes
  makes it possible to determine the photocatalytic contribution to the discoloration
  process when using MB as a test material. The photocatalytic activity of BNOx NPs
  containing 4.2 and 6.5 at.% of oxygen, estimated at ~440 μmol·g−1·h−1. The obtained
  results are discussed based on the results of DFT calculations considering the effect
  of MB sorption on its self-sensitizing photooxidation activity. A DFT analysis of
  the MB sorption capacity with BNOx NPs shows that surface oxygen defects prevent
  the sorption of MB molecules due to their planar orientation over the BNOx surface.
  To enhance the sorption capacity, surface oxygen defects should be eliminated.'
